# Docker Stack for running Propel2Â Unit Tests #

[Propel2]() is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for PHP 5.4.

This repository makes it straight-forward to run Propel2 Unit Tests locally and is aimed for those that wish to contribute to the Propel2 codebase. 

## Getting Started

Check out the source code to both this repo and Propel2, in side-by-side directories:

```
git clone -b develop https://github.com/neam/docker-stack-for-propel2-unit-tests.git
```

Install [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox).

## Running Unit Tests

To get a cross-platform Propel2 unit test environment with the required dependencies installed, start the docker unit test shell from within the repository's root folder:

```
eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
docker-compose run shell /bin/bash
```

Then run:

```
export DB_HOSTNAME=mysql
export DB_USER=root
export DB_PW=local-mysql-pass 
./tests/bin/setup.mysql.sh
./tests/bin/setup.sqlite.sh
phpunit
```

## TODO

Support for PostgreSQL is not complete. Pull requests welcome. 

```
DB_HOSTNAME=pgsql DB_USER=root DB_PW=local-pgsql-pass ./tests/bin/setup.pgsql.sh
```
